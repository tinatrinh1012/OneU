OneU is a degree planning web app service for college students. OneU allows students to have an interactive and easy-to-use degree planning platform with supporting features such as color code and degree validation to make sure the student is on track for graduation. 

OneU is developed as a prototype product for our team in gALPHA program at St. Thomas, organized by Gener8tor company. gALPHA is a 4-week venture creation program happens over J-term, in which participants team up as a company and work on building a business plan to gain experience in the startup process. Currently, OneU is not yet deployed and still using local database. We are working on fixing bugs and errors and deploying it to the web in the future.
